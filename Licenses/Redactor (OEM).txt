Redactor Installations

A Redactor Developer License, Corporate/Business License & OEM License purchases allow a multiple “live” installation in a production environment and ancillary “development use only” installations as needed to support the live installation (such as development and a staging servers). Additional installations do not require additional license purchases. If you have specific installation needs not covered by this license, please contact us. Imperavi will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes commercial activities.
